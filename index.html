    <h1>Why ducks are awsome!</h1>

    <h2>What makes ducks, ducks?</h2>
    <p1
      >Feet: Ducks have wide, strongly webbed feet that help them be powerful,
      efficient swimmers and in many cases, agile divers. The feet often have
      durable talons that help the birds grip different surfaces on land as
      well, including slippery rocks and branches, even if their body structure
      does not support agile walking. The color of the legs and feet can vary,
      but many ducks have brightly colored legs and feet, including yellow,
      orange, pink, or red.</p1

      >Bill: A duck's bill is typically broad and somewhat flattened to function
      as a more efficient food scoop or strainer, though there is great
      variation in bill shape and size among ducks. Most ducks also have a hard
      nail at the end of the bill to help them root for food. Slight serrations
      or a comb-like structure, called lamellae, on the sides of the bill, can
      help them strain the water for insects and other food. Some ducks have
      very colorful bills, including red, orange, yellow, pink, or even
      blue.</p2

    <p3
      >Body Shape: Ducks have a compact body that is efficient for streamlined
      swimming and preserving body heat when immersed in water. Their legs are
      typically set far back on their body, which makes them ungainly on land
      but gives them more power when swimming and diving. Oval body shapes are
      the most common for ducks, but the proportions of the oval vary from very
      slender to a plump, nearly round body.</p3

    <h2>Some fun facts about ducks:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The duck is a number of species in the Anatidae family of birds. They
        are related to swans and geese.
      </li>
      <li>
        A male duck is called a drake, a female duck a hen, and a baby duck a
        duckling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Diving ducks and sea ducks search for food fairly deep underwater. To be
        able to stay underwater more easily, diving ducks are quite heavy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ducks are mostly aquatic birds living in both fresh water and sea water
        and found on every continent except for Antarctica.
      </li>
      <li>
        A common urban legend is that a ducks quack does not echo. This has
        however, been proven to be false.
